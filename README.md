# Ex4-StdDraw of Diffrent ShapeCollection
Final task at computer science intro course in my first year.

This task opens up an infrastructure for shapes to represent shapes and collections of (two-dimensional) shapes, including a graphical interface.

All forms include point implemente the GeoShape interface, which includes various methods including area, perimeter, sliding, duplication, point containment testing etc.

This task include Junit test cases for all shapes and classes.

test_save.txt include different shapes with different coordinates the program read the file and draw the shapes in a basic graphical interface(StdDraw).
